Toy projects
============

This repository holds several toy projects and tools used for educative
purposes.

* **colouring** is an SDL2-based flooding game.
* **template** is a C project sample, showing how to structure a simple
  build environment using CMake.

Each directory in this repository is completely independent from the
others. The only reason they are together is convenience.
