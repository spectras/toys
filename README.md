Toy projects
============

This repository holds several toy projects and tools used for educative
purposes.

* **colouring** is an SDL2-based flooding game.
* **cubes** is the classical rotating cube demo, using modern OpenGL (shaders&buffers).
* **single** is a collection of one-file samples demonstrating a feature.
* **template-c-cmake** is a C project sample, showing how to structure a simple
  build environment using CMake.
* **template-python** is a python project sample with all boilerplate: unit tests, documentation
  generation, linter and packaging.

Each directory in this repository is completely independent from the
others. The only reason they are together is convenience.
